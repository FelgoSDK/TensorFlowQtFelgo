# TensorFlowQtVPlay
TensorFlow integration with Qt & V-Play

Description
-----------
Artificial intelligence and smart applications are steadily becoming more popular. Companies strongly rely on AI systems and machine learning to make faster and more accurate decisions based on their data.
This example shows how to create apps that take advantage of both QML and Qt C++.

TensorFlow is Google’s open machine learning framework. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and architectures (desktops, clusters of servers, mobile and edge devices).

This example integrates TensorFlow with V-Play and provides Image Classification and Object Detection features.

For the full integration guide how to use TensorFlow with Qt and V-Play, see:

For more information about creating Apps with V-Play Engine, see here: http://v-play.net/apps/.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
This app was made with V-Play Engine. You need the engine which is freely available on http://v-play.net/ for all desktop platforms.

1. Go to http://v-play.net/, register, download and install the free V-Play SDK.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the project file .pro in QtCreator (comes with V-Play SDK).
4. Hit run to start the app.

Where to get help
-----------------
If you need any help feel free to ask in the V-Play Forums https://v-play.net/developers/forums/ or have a look at our online documentation http://v-play.net/doc/.

Contribution guidelines
-----------------------
Currently there are no features open, but if you like to contribute use the code standards coming with the V-Play SDK.
