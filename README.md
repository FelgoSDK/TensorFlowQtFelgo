# TensorFlowQtFelgo
TensorFlow integration with Qt & Felgo

Description
-----------
Artificial intelligence and smart applications are steadily becoming more popular. Companies strongly rely on AI systems and machine learning to make faster and more accurate decisions based on their data.
This example shows how to create apps that take advantage of both QML and Qt C++.

TensorFlow is Google’s open machine learning framework. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and architectures (desktops, clusters of servers, mobile and edge devices).

This example integrates TensorFlow with Felgo and provides Image Classification and Object Detection features.

For the full integration guide how to use TensorFlow with Qt and Felgo, see:

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
This app was made with Felgo. You need the SDK which is freely available on https://felgo.com/ for all desktop platforms.

1. Go to https://felgo.com/, register, download and install the free Felgo SDK.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the project file .pro in QtCreator (comes with Felgo SDK).
4. Hit run to start the app.

Where to get help
